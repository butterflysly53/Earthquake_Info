 </p>
  Few features like: 
  
 - when did the earthquake happpen?
   
  - where did it happen? 
  
  - Magnitude of the earthquake etc...
                 
  Some older earthquake details are already stored in database. (see past earthquake section)
  
  Besides that Users can share their earthquake experience(if they encounter any) by fiilling up the `Form` atttached with the website's Home Page.
  That details will autometically get registered in the database And the newly entered place will be diplayed in the Map.
  
 
  #### To-Do:
