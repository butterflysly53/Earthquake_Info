    <h1> <u>What is an earthquake?</u> </h1>
    <p> An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a 
        sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that 
        are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, and wreak destruction 
        across entire cities. The seismicity, or seismic activity, of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced 
        over a period of time. The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling.
        <br>
        At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground. When the epicenter of 
        a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can also trigger 
        landslides and occasionally, volcanic activity.
        <br>
        In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event—whether natural or caused by humans—that
         generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity,
          landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. 
          The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.</p>
          <h1> <u>Why does earthquake so frequent?</u> </h1>
          <p>
              India has witnessed 127 miniature earthquakes in the first half of 2020. From the far east of Arunachal Pradesh to the far
               north of Kashmir 
              Valley, the south to national capital Delhi itself, minute tremors have become a daily affair. A similar trend has 
              been seen across the world. 
              But do they mean that a big one is one it's way? Here is what experts at the United States Geological Survey have to say. <br>
             <i> "A temporary increase or decrease in seismicity is part of the normal fluctuation of earthquake rates. 
              Neither an increase or decrease worldwide is a positive indication that a large earthquake is imminent."</i></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>There have been variations in the speed of the Earth's rotation</li>
                  <li>Activities like mining, nuclear explosions and groundwater extraction has seen an increase in
                       the number of human-induced earthquakes ..</li>
                  <li>Particularly from Indian perspective, Indian tectonic plate is slowly going underneath Eurasian plate
                       with the convergence rate of 47mm per year. Due to this energy accumulation in this region,
                        it is getting prone to greater magnitude earthqakes.</li>
              </ul>
            <h1> <u>Earthqakes:Do's and Dont's</u> </h1>
            <p>
                Stay as safe as possible during an earthquake. Be aware that some earthquakes are actually foreshocks and a larger earthquake 
                might occur.Minimize your movements to a few steps that reach a nearby safe place and stay indoors until the
                 shaking has stopped and  you are sure exiting is safe.
               <br>
                If indoors
                <br>
                
                DROP to the ground; take COVER by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and HOLD ON until the shaking stops. 
                If there is no a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.
                Protect yourself by staying under the lintel of an inner door, in the corner of a room, under a table or even under a bed.
                Stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, (such as lighting fixtures or furniture).
                Stay in bed if you are there when the earthquake strikes. Hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless 
                you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place.
                Use a doorway for shelter only if it is in close proximity to you and if you know it is a strongly supported, load bearing doorway.
                Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries occur when people inside 
                buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave.
                Be aware that the electricity may go out or the sprinkler systems or fire alarms may turn on.
                <br>
                If outdoors 
                <br>
                
                Do not move from where you are. However, move away from buildings, trees, streetlights, and utility wires.
                If you are in open space, stay there until the shaking stops. The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings; at exits;
                 and alongside exterior walls. Most earthquake-related casualties result from collapsing walls, flying glass, and falling objects.
                If in a moving vehicle
                
                Stop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, 
                and utility wires.
                Proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped. Avoid roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake.
                If trapped under debris
                
                Do not light a match.
                Do not move about or kick up dust.
                Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing.
                Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you. Use a whistle if one is available. Shout only as a last resort. 
                Shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust.
