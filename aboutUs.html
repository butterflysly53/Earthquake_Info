                 <h2>Hello World!</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a second year college student. I was making this website as my hobby project. 
                    <br>
                    I wanted to make a website which will have recent updates of earthquake happened in India along with some basic details like:
                    <ul>
                        <li >when did the earthquake happpen?</li>
                        <li >where did it happen? </li>
                        <li> Magnitude of the earthquake etc...</li>
                    </ul>
                    Some older earthquake details are stored in database. 
                    Besides that Users can share their earthquake experience(if they encounter any).
                    That details will autometically get registered in the database And the newly entered place will be diplayed by the Map. 
                </p>
